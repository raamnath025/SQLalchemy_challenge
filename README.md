# SQLAlchemy Challenge

For this challenge, I utilized a SQLite file to track create queries using SQLAlchemy. This allowed me to apply both my SQL and Python/Pandas knowledge. To start, I established an engine to connect to SQLAlchemy, then used Python and Pandas to generate queries to answer questions. After that, I created two visualizations based on the data. Lastly, I developed a Python Flask API with the app.py file, which included five links that provided answers to separate queries.
